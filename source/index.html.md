# Introduction

Welcome to the Snackify API! You can use this API to access Snackify API endpoints, which can get information on snacks, companies, users, and snacks selections.

This is subject to change without notice (but I'll do my best), so just be wary of that. If you've got a problem, you can take it up with my [complaint department](http://static.dudeiwantthat.com/img/gear/office/the-complaint-department-28718.jpg).

The base URL is:
